Version 1.1.3
[list]
[*]Added a new option to use vanilla sized biomes in standard BTA generation.
[*]Added the ability for tall grass, reeds, and saplings to grow on grassy clay.
[*]Changed how the end generates in all BTA world types to create slightly more interesitng terrain.
[*]Changed (increased) the height to which iron will generate in skylands given that at any given time the player is likely to be much higher in elevation that in vanilla.
[*]Changed sugar cane in skylands to no longer be restricted by biome given how rarely it still generates.
[*]Fixed an issue where fungal forest and fungal forest lowlands did not have the same grass color.
[/list]

Version 1.1.2
[list]
[*]Added the ability for temples and witch huts to spawn in skylands, although they may sometimes be floating over the void still.
[*]Changed sandy beaches in beta terrain to spawn with red sand in outback and badlands.
[*]Refactored several aspects of how world types are handled internally to make adding new types easier.
[*]Fixed an issue where the recent change to terracotta depth caused badlands to generate terracotta all the way to bedrock.
[/list]

Version 1.1.1
[list]
[*]Added skylands generation to the nether in skylands worlds. Ghast spawn rate has been significantly reduced in this world type given that tunneling is far less viable.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of surface water lakes in skylands given that there are no oceans. This improves the ability to farm and build mechanical builds which require water, and increases the frequency of sugar cane in biomes in which it can appear.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of surface lava lakes in skylands given that cave lava does not generate, making obsidian easier to aqcuire.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of times the game will attempt to generate dungeons in skylands to offset the number of dungeon spawns that fail from being in the void.
[*]Fixed an issue where skylands would always generate grass near y=64 even if the biome should not generate grass.
[*]Fixed an issue where sand and gravel beaches in beta terrain were generating incorrectly.
[*]Fixed an issue where the game would crash in multiplayer when generating savannas in beta or skylands if the server did not have deco installed.
[*]Fixed an issue where mineshafts were generating improperly in skylands in multiplayer.
[/list]

Version 1.1.0
[list]
[*]Added beta terrain gen world type. This world type uses BTA biomes but generates terrain based on old beta 1.7.3 terrain. Any seeds that worked in beta will work with this world type, although caves, ores, etc. will be different. This world type is also fully functional with all vanilla features such as strongholds, villages, mineshafts, ravines, etc.
[*]Added skylands world type (modified from the old sky dimension generator from beta). I make no claims that this is in any way balanced, I simply added it as something fun and unique. It is currently incomplete as it does not generate villages, temples, witch huts, or strongholds as they interacted very poorly with the skyland terrain. I will be making further adjustments to this world type to enable these structures.
[*]Changed how deco worlds are created. Instead of selecting a separate world type at world creation, there is now a button to toggle whether deco is enabled. Internally these are still handled as separate world types (only server owners should need to care about that).
[*]Changed mineshaft components to not generate if they would be entirely floating, and to only generate the shaft supports if they would actually be supporting blocks. This mostly affects skylands generation but may have small effects on other BTA world types. Vanilla world gen as always is unaffected.
[*]Changed (increased) the depth of terracotta in badlands.
[*]Changed tall grass and flowers to spawn already covered in snow in snow biomes if they are able to see the sky.
[*]Changed how fallen logs generate to have variance in their direction and to generate with a stump at one end.
[*]Changed red roses to spawn with the same frequency as other flowers in deco world types.
[*]Fixed an issue where emerald ore always spawned as first strata ore in BTA biomes.
[*]Fixed an issue where biome specific textures through MCPatcher did not work in BTA jungles or deserts.
[/list]

Version 1.0.2
[*]Changed versioning system.
[*]Fixed an issue where slimes were not spawning in swamp variants.

Version 1.0b
[*]Fixed an issue where acacia trees could generate stacked on top of each other like [url=https://i.imgur.com/gw9akGB.png]this[/url]
[*]Fixed an issue where unfinished custom villages were generating in the deco terrain world type. These villages will be properly added in a later release.

Version 1.0
[list]
[*]Added 26 new biomes, plus 4 deco exclusive biomes, each of which are detailed below.
[*]Added 2 new world types using the new biomes. The first will work for vanilla BTW, while the second is only enabled when Deco is also installed, and adds many of Deco's features to world gen.
[*]Added the /biome command to be able to see the name of the current biome.
[*]Added the ability for clay to generate in sand and red sand. Given that some biomes exclusively use sand or red sand for their lake and river beds, this was done to enable clay spawning in those biomes. However, the overall spawn rate of clay has been reduced by 33% to compensate for the increase in viable spawn areas. This only affects this addon's world types.
