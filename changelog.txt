Version 2.1.0
[list]
[*]Added nether biomes, which are detailed further below. This may be toggled at world creation, and all nether related changes only apply to worlds with the new nether enabled. New nether features require Deco 2.16.0 or higher.
[*]Added nether wastes. This is almost identical to the vanilla nether, except it generates with new BTA features. Ghasts, zombie pigmen, and magma cubes can spawn here.
[*]Added basalt deltas. This highly rugged terrain has a surface made of basalt and infused stone filled with frequent lava pools. Magma cubes spawn here in high frequencies.
[*]Added soul sand valleys. This biome has soul sand as its primary surface block and can spawn skeletons, along with ghasts at a higher frequency than other biomes.
[*]Added crystal caverns. This biome generates black stone and amethyst in high abundance, with large amethyst spikes and scattered amethyst shards.
[*]Added dried up lavafalls made of basalt to all nether biomes.
[*]Added clusters of magma blocks near the lava ocean in all nether biomes. These spawn more frequently in basalt deltas.
[*]Added large clusters of infused stone near the lava ocean in all nether biomes. These spawn at any height in basalt deltas.
[*]Changed how fortress mob spawns are handled. Previously, the game would choose the fortress spawn list instead of the biome spawn list. To accommodate new biome-specific spawn lists in the nether, fortresses now add their own unique spawns to the exisitng biome spawns.
[*]Changed how skeletons determine their type in BTA worlds. Fortress skeletons will now always spawn as wither skeletons (instead of an 80% chance), while skeletons outside fortresses (e.g. in the new biomes) will always spawn as normal skeletons. Vanilla nether is unaffected.
[*]Changed black stone to be able to spawn nether mobs.
[/list]

Version 2.0.0
[list]
[*]Updated to BTW CE 1.1.X.
[*]Added blobs of deco slate in third strata.
[*]Changed ancient forests to have varying tree density and to be slightly less dense overall. This should make it just a little safer as there will be fewer spaces that mobs can spawn in during the day, and hopefully should reduce the impact fire can have on the biome.
[*]Changed the internal name of BTA's desert hills to "Better Desert Hills" and jungle hills to "Better Jungle Hills" for compatibility with MCPatcher's biome specific textures.
[*]Fixed an issue where the /biome command always gave the biome at the current coordinates in the overworld instead of respecting the current dimension of the player.
[*]Fixed an issue where structure-specific mobs could not spawn in any BTA biomes (this doesn't actually have any impact right now, but if any other addons added mob spawns to structures they previously would not have worked without this fix).
[*]Fixed an issue where fortress mobs could not spawn in skylands.
[/list]

Version 1.4.4
[list]
[*]Fixed an issue where the game could crash when generating sand when better shores is disabled.
[/list]

Version 1.4.3
[list]
[*]Updated to API 1.1.1
[*]Fixed an issue causing noise generators to not respect the seed after the first world generated after booting the game.
[*]Fixed an issue where attempting to create a vanilla world type with BTA and deco installed would create the wrong world type if you did not toggle deco beforehand.
[*]Fixed an issue where beta and skylands worlds generated far too few trees.
[/list]

Version 1.4.2
[list]
[*]Fixed an issue where any changes using random generators would result in the terrain noise being initialized in a different way, causing large world seams if anything was changed (to the point where unrelated mods could affect the generation). This only affected 1.4.X worlds so older worlds are fine. However, the fix for this necessitated causing one more world seam, so any worlds that were generated with 1.4.0 or 1.4.1 will have different generation now. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but damage should be minimal given the same day release and the fact that old worlds were unaffected by the bug as they do not use the new generator system that 1.4.X worlds do.
[*]Fixed an issue where frozen beaches and red sand beaches would spawn normal beaches at their edges.
[/list]

Version 1.4.1
[list]
[*]Fixed an issue where some of the changes to badlands edges were not checking the world version and thus could create seams.
[/list]

Version 1.4.0
[list]
[*]Added a new surface builder system which allows much finer control over how biomes are generated. This includes incorporation of K.JPG's OpenSimplex2 (more information in credits section of OP).
[*]Added areas of podzol and coarse dirt to coniferous forests and snowy coniferous forests in new worlds when deco is enabled.
[*]Completely overhauled badlands in new worlds. They now match vanilla badlands much more closely. This is detailed more in the changes below.
[*]Changed badlands plateaus to actually be plateaus instead of just normal mountains.
[*]Changed badlands plateaus to use normal terracotta as the topmost block at high elevations.
[*]Changed badlands plateaus to spawn occasional wooded sections atop the plateaus.
[*]Changed how terracotta layers generate in badlands to be more common and to be random based on the world seed instead of fixed and periodic. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed badlands plateau to use regular badlands as its edge biome rather than having a dedicated badlands edge. Badlands edge will continue to generate in existing worlds but has been deprecated for old worlds.
[*]Changed grass and foliage color of badlands.
[*]Changed (reduced) the width of badlands edges in new worlds.
[*]Changed (reduced) the number of trees slightly in coniferous forest variants in new worlds.
[*]Changed how sandy shorelines generate to use simplex noise instead of perlin to remove occasional directional artifacting. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed how grass generates in outback to make it based on simplex noise instead of random decorators. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed how surface stone generates in arid forest, chaparral, and shield in new worlds in the same way as outback grass above.
[*]Changed how trees generate in alpine, steppe, orchard, heathland, coniferous forest, snowy coniferous forest, and icy peaks in new worlds. Instead of relying on sub-biomes to modify tree type or density, tree generation is now based on simplex noise. As a part of this, aspen grove, wooded steppe, orchard clearing, heathland woods, coniferous forest clearing, snowy coniferous forest clearing, and forested icy peaks have been deprecated. These sub-biomes wil continue to generate in existing worlds but have been removed from new worlds.
[*]Changed alpine to generate fewer trees at high elevations in new worlds.
[*]Changed oasis (for real this time!) and steppe to not spawn sandy shorelines in new worlds.
[*]Fixed an issue where large oak trees (the vanilla ones) would sometimes all generate at the exact same size in an entire biome.
[*]Fixed an issue where beaches were generating with grass. This may cause surface material seams but can be manually fixed relatively easily (or old chunks can be deleted in MCEdit and they will regenerate)
[*]Fixed an issue where frozen beaches were generating in places they shouldn't. Existing frozen beaches will revert to normal beaches.
[/list]

Version 1.3.4
[list]
[*]Updated to Extended Addon API 1.1.0.
[/list]

Version 1.3.3
[list]
[*]Added new red sandstone desert pyramids which can spawn in outback and badlands.
[*]Added the ability to double click biomes in the biome configuration menu to toggle whether they are enabled.
[*]Changed world configuration to have deco generation enabled by default if deco is also installed. Deco generation may still be disabled if you wish.
[*]Changed world configuration so that enabling deco automatically enables all deco exclusive biomes. Previously it was possible to enable deco but then not get deco biomes because you had to specifically re-enable them.
[*]Fixed an issue where frozen springs, plains, temperate forest, and patagonia were not properly generating reeds.
[*]Fixed an issue where the game would crash if spaces were present in the generator options string.
[/list]

Version 1.3.2
[list]
[*]Added edge variants to rainforest and jungle in new worlds which have slightly less dense vegetation, and which will not spawn melons. This helps provide a transition into the heavy vegetation of these biomes, and makes easy melons harder to obtain by preventing them from spawning at the very edge of these jungle variants.
[*]Added an edge variant to tropics in new worlds, causing it to be much more likely to spawn as islands instead of connecting to neighboring biomes. When tropics does connect via land, it is likely to do so through sandy beaches.
[*]Added a BTA version of the vanilla beach, for the same reason as I previously did the same for rivers. This again will not affect anything in your world, but simply allows me to do more with beaches down the line if I wish.
[*]Added frozen beaches. Snowy woods, frozen springs, siberia, and tundra will now spawn frozen beaches when connecting with oceans. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed how reeds generate in frozen springs slightly to make them a bit more common.
[*]Changed (increased) the thickness of the border created by all edge variants. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed (increased) the chance of melons spawning in jungle, rainforest, and mangal to offset the large amount of vegetation present (or water in the case of mangal) which could prevent them from spawning.
[*]Changed (decreased) the chance of melons spawning in tropics given that it is easier to traverse than other jungle variants and has less vegetation.
[*]Fixed an issue where the game would crash when trying to smooth between climates when no biomes of the transition climate were enabled. The game will now not attempt to smooth climates if no biomes are available for smoothing.
[*]Fixed an issue where particularly wide rivers could generate with a standard river along the center even if the rest of the river was a different variant. This was most notable as a change in water color but could also show up as missing ice, mismatching riverbed material, or having a random spot of rain in the middle of the river in desert variants.
[/list]

Version 1.3.1
[list]
[*]Fixed an issue causing the game to generate highlands instead of mountains. Any highlands generated in the previous release will be converted to mountains. Worlds created before 1.3.0 will revert to exactly how they were before 1.3.0. This may cause slight biome color seams in 1.3.0 worlds but given that the two biomes have exactly the same terrain generation will not cause any terrain seams. MCEdit may be used to replace biome id 125 with 145 to make the biomes colors match what they should, or MCEdit can be used to delete any of those chunks and the game will generate them correctly the next time you are in the area.
[*]Fixed an issue where frozen springs would still generate cherry trees if deco was installed but deco world generation was disabled.
[/list]

Version 1.3.0
[list]
[*]Added climate zones. This can be configured at world creation, and is enabled by default. This means biomes will now be clustered according to their climate: Snowy, cold, temperate, tropical, or arid. Climates are randomly distributed, then smoothed to prevent disjointed transitions between climates. A full list of which biomes belong to which climate is available in the OP.
[*]Added height-dependent snowfall in cold biomes. Snow will fall anywhere in these biomes above y=95. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Added frozen springs as a new snowy biome which can generate reeds.
[*]Added boreal forest as a new cold taiga variant (wolves) and renamed the old boreal forest to temperate forest.
[*]Added mangal (mangrove forest) as a new temperate jungle variant (temples, jungle spiders, reeds).
[*]Added arid forest as a new arid forest variant (duh). Arid forest also replaces woods as a sub-biome for plains in new worlds.
[*]Added shield as a new cold taiga variant (wolves).
[*]Added brushland as a new cold plains variant (villages, pumpkins).
[*]Added highlands as a new temperate mountain variant (emeralds, silverfish).
[*]Added pockets of water to wetlands, willow grove, jungle, and rainforest, similar to how vanilla generates water in jungles and swamps. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Added small oasis pockets inside lush deserts in addition to the large ones. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Added the ability for reeds to spawn in patagonia, plains, and temperate forest. In the new climate distribution system it was possible to have extremely large distances between biomes which could spawn reeds, which could be a problem given how vital they are early game. So this, combined with frozen springs above, ensures every climate is capable of spawning reeds in at least one biome. However, tropical climates remain where reeds can be found most commonly.
[*]Added the ability for melons to spawn on the surface in jungle variants (jungle, rainforest, tropics, mangal).
[*]Added the ability for emeralds and silverfish to spawn in dunes.
[*]Added a hook for other addons to add their own biomes to BTA world generation.
[*]Changed configuration menu to have biome configration on its own page.
[*]Changed the formatting of the generator options string. The old format will still be processed correctly for old worlds but will not contain any new options. The new format ignores whitespace, has labels for all options, and is order-agnostic.
[*]Changed ocean size configuration to be a scale from 1 (off) to 10 (vanilla), defaulting to 5.
[*]Changed (increased) possible biome size ranges to 0.5x to 4x vanilla (Original BTA was 2x, vanilla large biomes is 4x). As a part of this, small world types have been deprecated as biome size information is now handled through generator options. These world types will continue to function for existing worlds but may no longer be created.
[*]Changed the default biome size to vanilla sized biomes as the new climate zone system tends to spread out dissimilar biomes further than before.
[*]Changed the display name of a few biomes in world configuration to match the generic name rather than specific sub-biome names. Internal biome names remain the same, and are still listed in the OP (internal biome names only concern texture pack authors using MCPatcher).
[*]Changed oases to no longer spawn sand from better shorelines. This only affects new worlds.
[*]Changed biome colors for plains and steppe.
[*]Changed tundra to no longer be a valid biome for world spawn.
[*]Fixed an issue where frozen rivers weren't frozen. Any which have generated in your world in the last release that weren't frozen will naturally refreeze as you spend time near them. The biome locations were correct, just not the precipitation data.
[*]Fixed an issue where wetland hills and willow grove hills would spawn standard rivers within them and not jungle rivers, leading to mismatched water color.
[*]Fixed an issue where beta and skylands world types always generated vanilla sized biomes, regardless of world configuration settings.
[list]

Version 1.2.1
[list]
[*]Added plains, modified from the vanilla version.
[*]Added BTA versions of river and frozen river. This does nothing except allow me to control how decorations spawn in them.(most notably allowing me to limit vanilla sand spawning for better shorelines).
[*]Added the ability for desert temples to spawn in steppes.
[*]Changed how version compatibility is handled internally to have finer control. This largely only concerns server owners and is detailed in the server section of the OP.
[*]Changed the biome colors of grasslands slightly.
[*]Changed the position of buttons in the BTA world configuration menu.
[*]Fixed an issue where badlands edge, badlands river, outback river, and red sand beach were generating regular sand near sea level instead of red sand when better shorelines were enabled.
[*]Fixed an issue where toggling buttons in beta or skylands configuration would change the text of the oceans button to on, despite the fact that those world types cannot generate oceans.
[*]Fixed an issue where the better shorelines button was enabled when creating beta and skylands worlds, despite the setting not affecting those world types (beta always has it turned on, and there is no sea level in skylands to generate shores).
[*]Fixed an issue where the setting for better shorelines was always being set to true at world creation regardless of the state of the button in the configuration menu.
[*]Fixed an issue where sand would not generate underwater at all in legacy (pre 1.2.0) worlds.
[*]Fixed an issue where jungle hills would spawn standard rivers within them and not jungle rivers, leading to mismatched water color.
[*]Fixed an issue where jungle rivers did not spawn enough sand when using vanilla sand generation.
[*]Fixed an issue where willow groves were not able to spawn witch huts, reeds, or slimes.
[/list]

Version 1.2.0
Note: This release adds several new biomes and world generation options. However, I have specifically made sure that existing worlds are unaffected and as such you do not need to worry about compatibility when upgrading to this version. However, it is still good practice to backup your worlds.
[list]
[*]Added expanded configuration to BTA world creation. This allows selecting and deselecting biomes to include in world generation, as well as other configuration options. In addition, this allows me to add new biomes without breaking old worlds by tying the biome list to the save file. To generate any of the new biomes added in this release, you will have to create a new world.
[*]Added the ability to replace sand generation with beta's sand and gravel beaches on world creation.
[*]Added the ability to disable oceans on world creation. Future releases will allow for finer control than a strict toggle.
[*]Added willow groves as a new swamp variant (witches, slimes, reeds).
[*]Added icy peaks as a new mountain variant (emeralds, silverfish).
[*]Added patagonia as a new plains variant (villages, pumpkins) which spawns occasional tall, stony mountains within (emeralds, silverfish).
[*]Added grasslands as a new plains variant (villages, pumpkins).
[*]Added siberia as a new taiga variant (wolves).
[*]Changed skylands cloud height to render below the bottom of the world (reduced y level from 8 to -8).
[*]Changed how tropics generates sandy shores to match valley. This does not affect existing worlds so will not cause seams.
[*]Fixed an issue where reeds could not generate along rivers in jungles.
[*]Fixed an issue in the create world menu where buttons would overlap on low resolution screens or at very high GUI scales.
[*]Fixed an issue where the gui would not properly reflect world configuration when using the recreate world option.
[/list]

Version 1.1.3
[list]
[*]Removed space in the filename to assist users on linux.
[*]Added a new option to use vanilla sized biomes in standard BTA generation. The world types are "BTASmall" and "BTASmallDeco" for server owners.
[*]Added the ability for clay to replace grass in standard (waterlogged) generation. This allows clay to form on shores in grass like it does in sand variants.
[*]Added the ability for tall grass, reeds, and saplings to grow on grassy clay.
[*]Changed how the end generates in all BTA world types to create slightly more interesting terrain.
[*]Changed (increased) the height to which iron will generate from 64 to 80 in skylands given that at any given time the player is likely to be much higher in elevation that in vanilla.
[*]Changed sugar cane in skylands to no longer be restricted by biome given how rarely it still generates.
[*]Fixed an issue where fungal forest and fungal forest lowlands did not have the same grass color.
[*]Fixed an issue where clay patches that overlapped would always generate dirt clay even if the rest of the patch was based on a different block type.
[/list]

Version 1.1.2
[list]
[*]Added the ability for temples and witch huts to spawn in skylands, although they may sometimes be floating over the void still.
[*]Changed sandy beaches in beta terrain to spawn with red sand in outback and badlands.
[*]Refactored several aspects of how world types are handled internally to make adding new types easier.
[*]Fixed an issue where the recent change to terracotta depth caused badlands to generate terracotta all the way to bedrock.
[/list]

Version 1.1.1
[list]
[*]Added skylands generation to the nether in skylands worlds. Ghast spawn rate has been significantly reduced in this world type given that tunneling is far less viable.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of surface water lakes in skylands given that there are no oceans. This improves the ability to farm and build mechanical builds which require water, and increases the frequency of sugar cane in biomes in which it can appear.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of surface lava lakes in skylands given that cave lava does not generate, making obsidian easier to aqcuire.
[*]Changed (increased) the number of times the game will attempt to generate dungeons in skylands to offset the number of dungeon spawns that fail from being in the void.
[*]Fixed an issue where skylands would always generate grass near y=64 even if the biome should not generate grass.
[*]Fixed an issue where sand and gravel beaches in beta terrain were generating incorrectly.
[*]Fixed an issue where the game would crash in multiplayer when generating savannas in beta or skylands if the server did not have deco installed.
[*]Fixed an issue where mineshafts were generating improperly in skylands in multiplayer.
[/list]

Version 1.1.0
[list]
[*]Added beta terrain gen world type. This world type uses BTA biomes but generates terrain based on old beta 1.7.3 terrain. Any seeds that worked in beta will work with this world type, although caves, ores, etc. will be different. This world type is also fully functional with all vanilla features such as strongholds, villages, mineshafts, ravines, etc.
[*]Added skylands world type (modified from the old sky dimension generator from beta). I make no claims that this is in any way balanced, I simply added it as something fun and unique. It is currently incomplete as it does not generate villages, temples, witch huts, or strongholds as they interacted very poorly with the skyland terrain. I will be making further adjustments to this world type to enable these structures.
[*]Changed how deco worlds are created. Instead of selecting a separate world type at world creation, there is now a button to toggle whether deco is enabled. Internally these are still handled as separate world types (only server owners should need to care about that).
[*]Changed mineshaft components to not generate if they would be entirely floating, and to only generate the shaft supports if they would actually be supporting blocks. This mostly affects skylands generation but may have small effects on other BTA world types. Vanilla world gen as always is unaffected.
[*]Changed (increased) the depth of terracotta in badlands.
[*]Changed tall grass and flowers to spawn already covered in snow in snow biomes if they are able to see the sky.
[*]Changed how fallen logs generate to have variance in their direction and to generate with a stump at one end.
[*]Changed red roses to spawn with the same frequency as other flowers in deco world types.
[*]Fixed an issue where emerald ore always spawned as first strata ore in BTA biomes.
[*]Fixed an issue where biome specific textures through MCPatcher did not work in BTA jungles or deserts.
[/list]

Version 1.0.2
[*]Changed versioning system.
[*]Fixed an issue where slimes were not spawning in swamp variants.

Version 1.0b
[*]Fixed an issue where acacia trees could generate stacked on top of each other like [url=https://i.imgur.com/gw9akGB.png]this[/url]
[*]Fixed an issue where unfinished custom villages were generating in the deco terrain world type. These villages will be properly added in a later release.

Version 1.0
[list]
[*]Added 26 new biomes, plus 4 deco exclusive biomes, each of which are detailed below.
[*]Added 2 new world types using the new biomes. The first will work for vanilla BTW, while the second is only enabled when Deco is also installed, and adds many of Deco's features to world gen.
[*]Added the /biome command to be able to see the name of the current biome.
[*]Added the ability for clay to generate in sand and red sand. Given that some biomes exclusively use sand or red sand for their lake and river beds, this was done to enable clay spawning in those biomes. However, the overall spawn rate of clay has been reduced by 33% to compensate for the increase in viable spawn areas. This only affects this addon's world types.
[/list]
