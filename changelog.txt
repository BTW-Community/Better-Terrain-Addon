Version 1.0
[list]
[*]Added many new biomes, each of which are detailed below.
[*]Added 2 new world types. The first will work for vanilla BTW, while the second is only enabled when Deco is also installed, and adds many of Deco's features to world gen.
[*]Added the ability for clay to generate in sand and red sand. Given that some biomes exclusively use sand or red sand for their lake and river beds, this was done to enable clay spawning in those biomes. However, the overall spawn rate of clay has been reduced to compensate for in increase in viable spawn areas. This only affects new this addon's world types.

The occurance of various different world gen features per biome is kept as close as possible to there frequency in vanilla BTW to maintain balance.
